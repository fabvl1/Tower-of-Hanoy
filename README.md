# Tower of Hanoi

This repository contains an implementation of the classic "Tower of Hanoi" game in Java. The project was developed as a school assignment to practice programming logic, data structures, and basic Java principles.

## Description

The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle that involves moving a stack of disks from one peg to another, following these rules:

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. A larger disk may not be placed on top of a smaller disk.
3. All disks start stacked on a single peg in order of decreasing size (largest on the bottom).

## Features

- Full implementation in Java.
- Handles all game rules and logic.
- Clean, well-commented code for educational purposes.

## Usage

### Running the Java Source

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fabvl1/Tower-of-Hanoy.git
   ```
2. Compile the project:
   ```bash
   javac Main.java
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   java Main
   ```
   > Replace `Main.java` with the name of the file containing the `main` method if different.

### Running the Executable

A precompiled Windows executable (.exe) is included in this repository for convenience.  
You can run the program directly by double-clicking the `.exe` file or executing it from the command line:

```bash
Tower-of-Hanoi.exe
```

> Note: The .exe file was generated from the Java source code and is provided for easy access on Windows systems.
